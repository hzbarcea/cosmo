OSAF Server Bundle


WHAT IS THE SERVER BUNDLE?
==========================

The OSAF Sever Bundle integrates the Chandler Server (Cosmo)
with the Tomcat servlet container and the Derby embedded database
to provide an integrated, easy-to-run calendar server.  The server
bundle also includes configuration options and the MySQL Connector/J
JDBC driver to run Cosmo against a MySQL 5 database server.

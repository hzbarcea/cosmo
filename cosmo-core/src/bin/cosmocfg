# Environment configuration file for the cosmoctl script.
#
# The environment variables set by this file control features of
# various components within Cosmo. These features are specified by
# command line options passed to the JVM.
#
# Each of the commented out lines below sets an environment variable
# to its default value. You may leave these commented out, as cosmoctl
# will use a variable's default value if the variable is unset. If you
# uncomment one of these lines or set the variable yourself, cosmoctl
# will use that value instead and will log a message to that end.
#
# $JAVA_OPTS is unaffected by this file. Administrators may use this
# environment variable to specify additional options to the JVM as
# usual.
#


#
# This feature enables the JVM's JMX agent for local monitoring and
# management. See
# <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html>
# for more details.
#
#COSMO_JMX_LOCAL=true

#
# This feature allows iCalendar objects with both LF and CRLF line
# endings (RFC 2445 mandates CRLF, but some implementations only use
# LF). To disable this feature and require strict line endings, set
# the variable to false or 0.
#
#COSMO_ICAL4J_UNFOLDING_RELAXED=true

#
# This feature allows you to redirect Derby's logging output to
# another location on the filesystem. Derby unfortunately uses a
# proprietary logging mechanism rather than commons-logging or log4j,
# so we have to treat its logfile specially.
#
# The filesystem path is interpreted relative to $COSMO_HOME, the top
# level directory of the Cosmo distribution (the directory above this
# one).
#
#COSMO_DERBY_ERROR_LOG=logs/derby.log

#
# This feature controls whether Derby will overwrite its log file
# when it starts up or whether it will append to an existing log
# file. The default is to append to an existing file. To have the file
# overwritten, set the variable to false or 0.
#
#COSMO_DERBY_ERROR_LOG_APPEND=true

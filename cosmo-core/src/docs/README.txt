Chandler Server (Cosmo)

What is Chandler Server?
========================

Chandler Server is a calendar server. With your favorite calendar program
(Chandler, Apple iCal, Mozilla Sunbird, or any other WebDAV or CalDAV
enabled client), you can share your calendar with other people by
publishing it to Chandler Server. Once your calendar is stored on the server,
you can give permission for others to subscribe to it, and even modify
it if their calendar client allows.

Chandler Server is a file server. You can store arbitrary files in your home
directory in Chandler Server with any WebDAV client (including the Windows XP,
Linux and Apple OS X file managers), and you can share them with
others in the same way as your calendar.

Chandler Server is not a content management system. There is no support for
common CMS features such as versioning, content editing or
workflow. Chandler Server very simply allows calendar and file management
applications to publish and subscribe to a content repository.

Implements the CMP protocol for server management.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The Cosmo Management Protocol (CMP) offers programmatic access to
management functionality not otherwise covered by WebDAV. The guiding
principle is that any task that can be accomplished with the Web
Console must also be possible via CMP, WebDAV, or another network
protocol.

See the <a
href="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Projects/CosmoManagementProtocol">CMP
specification for full details.</a>
